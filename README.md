# Project 4: Reinforcement Learning (Course project MLDL 2024 - POLITO)

The objective of this project is to explore the application of Reinforcement Learning to train an agent to perform jumping tasks. This is done by comparing the efficiency of different algorithms on tasks of varying complexity. We incorporate a domain randomization technique to improve the robustness of these algorithms. Specifically, domain randomization is employed to manage variability in masses and the inclination of the plane. Finally we implement a dynamical variant of the Uniform domain randomization, compare the performances of the algorithms and evaluate the models' adaptability to different environmental conditions during testing.
